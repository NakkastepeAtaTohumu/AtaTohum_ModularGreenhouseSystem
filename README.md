# AtaTohum_ModularGreenhouseSystem
This project proposes to develop a modular greenhouse system which will improve the growth of plants, automatically water them, control their humidity and temperature and a lot more. The system will be composed of a series of modules that can be configured in a variety of ways to meet the needs of different types of plants. The modules will be connected together using premade cables and will be able to communicate with each other in order to monitor and adjust the environment of the plants. The system will also be able to keep track of the growth of each plant and provide data that can be used to make adjustments to the environment. The system will also be able to monitor the soil PH value and make adjustments accordingly. Finally, the system will be able to provide alerts when it detects that a plant is in danger or in need of attention.
