# AtaTohum_ModularGreenhouseSystem

Welcome to **AtaTohum Modular Greenhouse System**, an advanced automated solution for optimizing plant growth in a modular greenhouse environment. With features like automatic watering, climate control, soil pH monitoring, and growth tracking, this system ensures that your plants thrive with minimal manual intervention. Designed for flexibility, the system can be easily configured to suit a variety of plant types and greenhouse setups.

## üå± Project Overview

The **AtaTohum Modular Greenhouse System** is built around modular units that work together to create a fully automated and customizable greenhouse. Each module communicates with others to monitor and adjust the environmental conditions necessary for plant health. The system features:

- **Automated Watering**: Precise water distribution based on real-time needs.
- **Temperature & Humidity Control**: Keeps the greenhouse environment stable.
- **Growth Analytics**: Collects data on plant growth and adjusts the environment accordingly.
- **Data Logging**: Logs the data for easy and remote access in addition to multiple charts and analysis features.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Modular System**: Flexible and scalable design that adapts to different plant needs.
- **Real-Time Environmental Measure**: Automated measuring for temperature, humidity, and soil conditions.
- **Cross-Module Communication**: Interconnected modules ensure environmental consistency.

## üîß How It Works

1. **Modular Design**: The system is composed of multiple independent modules, each responsible for a specific task like watering, climate control, or soil monitoring. These modules can be connected using pre-wired cables to form a comprehensive greenhouse solution.
   
2. **Real-Time Data**: Sensors monitor parameters like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, while microcontrollers on the ESP32 process this data and communicate with other modules to make adjustments.

3. **Web Dashboard**: Through the use of a raspberry pi, the project uploads all the data to a nosql database for monitoring greenhouse status and remote access.


## üìä Data & Analytics

- **Growth Dashboard**: Users can view real-time data on plant health, water levels, temperature, humidity, and soil pH.
- **Growth Analytics**: Tracks trends and offers insights into plant progress and system performance.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **C++** for core functionality and system operations.
- **ESP32** boards to handle sensor data and communicate between modules.
- **FNET** custom in house solution for communication between modules.

Happy growing! üåøüå±
